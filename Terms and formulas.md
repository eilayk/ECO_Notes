# Terms

## Chapter 1

**Economics**: Study of how scarce resources are allocated

**Macroeconomics**: Studies the economy's structure, operation, and performance as a whole

**Opportunity cost**: whatever must be given up to obtain it. 
- Example: An extra year of university is not just tuition, books, and fees but also forgone wages

**Margin**: difference/change

**Incentive**: something that induces someone to behave a specific way

**Market**: how buyers and sellers trade a particular product. Can be physical place or website.

**GDP (gross domestic product) per capita**: amount of goods produced per hour of a worker's time

**Inflation**: the increase in overall level of prices

**Unemployment**: Number of people who don't have a job are seeking one

## Chapter 2

**Economic model:** A simplified representation of a more complicated reality
- Uses reasonable assumptions to simplify the situation
- Often in the form of diagrams and equations

**Positive statements:** can be confirmed or refuted based on evidence

**Normative statements:** cannot be confirmed or refuted based on evidence

**Circular-Flow Diagram:** Simplified model that shows production = spending = income

**Production Possibilities Frontier**: Compares resources that the economy can produce given factors of production and technology 

**Positive correlation:** Event A and event B both rise or both fall

**Negative correlation:** Event A and rises while event B falls or vice versa

**Causation:** One event brings about another

## Chapter 5

**GDP**: 
- Value of all economic activity within a country
- The unduplicated market value of all goods & services produced within a country in a given period of time.

**Net exports (NX)**: exports - imports 

**Gross National Income (GNI) and Gross National Product (GNP):**
- All final goods and services produced by a countryâ€™s residents, regardless of where they live.

**Net National Product (NNP):** GNP - depreciation 

**National Income (NI):** NNP - sales tax + subsidies

**Capital consumption allowance:** depreciation

**Personal Income (PI):** NI + income received but not earned  - income earned but not received

**Disposable personal income:** PI - personal income taxes

**GDP Deflator:** Can be used to find inflation rate between two given years

**Nominal GDP:** The strength of the economy in current $
- Grows both because prices rise and because the economy grows
- Can increase due to inflation

**Real GDP:** The strength of the economy in the $ of a previous year
- Takes inflation out of the economy
- Can really see if the economy grew or shrunk

## Chapter 6

**Cost of living:** level of prices in an economy

**Purchasing power:** how much a dollar can buy given prices

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Measures price changes by comparing the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services over a period of time
- Used to make cost of living adjustments in wages, pensions, government social programs

**Canadian Pension Plan (CPP)**: mandatory federal public pension plan
- Adjusted yearly based on CPI changes

**OAS**: Non-contributory, residence-based program with the objective of ensuring a minimum income to Canadians aged 65 and over.
- Adjusted quarterly to reflect increases in CPI

**Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS):** program that provides monthly non-taxable benefit to OAS recipients in low income
- Adjusted quarterly to reflect increases in CPI

**Producer Price Indexes (PPIs)**: Like CPI, a PPI measures the cost of a given basket of goods
- There are many PPIs that cover different economic activities
- PPIs measure prices that producers receive, meaning it is caught higher in the value/supply chain
	- Thus, they can signal changes in CPI before they happen

**Indexation**: wages rise (albeit slowly) over time to offset effects of inflation and maintain purchasing power
- A dollar amount is indexed for inflation if it is automatically corrected to inflation by law or contract

**The law of one price**: goods should sell for the same price in all markets

**Purchasing power parity (PPP)**: Theory that purchasing power in different countries should be the same when stated in a common currency
- Based on law of one price

**The Big Mac Index**: PPP index that describes differences in prices for Big Macs across locations

**Nominal interest rate**: not corrected for inflation
- the rate of growth in the dollar value of a deposit or debt

**real interest rate**: corrected for inflation
- the rate of growth in purchasing power of a debt or deposit

## Chapter 7

**Compounding**: Economic growth builds on itself over time

**Productivity**: The average quantity of goods and services produced per hour of a worker's time

**Free** **trade**: the principle that trade can make everyone better off


# Formulas

Price level formula:
$$P_{2} = P_{1}(1+\pi)^n$$
- $P$ is price level
- $\pi$ is inflation rate
- $n$ is number of years

GDP per capita: 
$$\frac{GDP}{population}$$
GDP Deflator: 
$$\frac{GDP_{Nominal}}{GDP_{Real}}\times100$$
Finding inflation using GDP deflator:
```math
\frac{{GDP \: Deflator}_{current \: year} - {GDP \: Deflator}_{previous \: year}}{{GDP \: Deflator}_{previous \: year}}\times100
```

Calculating CPI:
```math
CPI=\frac{Cost\:of\:basket\:in\:desired\:year}{Cost\:of\:basket\:in\:base\:year}\times100
```

Calculating inflation rate using % change in CPI:
```math
inflation\:rate=\frac{CPI\:this\:period\:-\:CPI\:for\:previous\:period}{CPI\:for\:previous\:period}\times100
```
Comparing prices from two different years:
- Can also use PPI or GDP deflator to compare
```math
price\:in\:desired\:year=price\:in\:base\:year\:\times\frac{CPI\:in\:desired\:year}{CPI\:in\:base\:year}
```

Comparing values of currency using PPP index:
$$Y=\frac{currency_{1}-currency_{2}}{currency_{2}}\times100$$
where Y is the value of currency2 relative to currency1. 

Comparing different GDP per capita using PPP indexes:
```math
price\:level\:adustment=\frac{PPP\:Index-Market\:ER}{Market\:ER}\times100$$
```
```math
PPP\:adjusted\:GDP\:per\:capita=\frac{GDP\:per\:capita}{1+Price\:level\:adjustment}
```

Nominal vs real interest rates:
- nominal interest rate = i
- real interest rate = r
- inflation = $\pi$
approximate formula:
$$r \approx i - \pi$$
real formula:
$$r=\frac{i-\pi}{1+\pi}$$

Growth rate:
```math
Growth\:rate = \%\Delta in\:nominal\:GDP - inflation - \%\Delta in\:population
```


Compounding:
$$GDP_{yr\:A}\times(1+g)^n=GDP_{yr\:B}$$
where
- g = annual average growth rate
- n = number of years

Rule of 70: simple way to check how long it takes for income to double
$$n=\frac{70}{g\times100}$$
where
- n = number of years
- g = percent interest rate

Total production output:
```math
Total\:Production = A \times F(L,K,H,N)
```
