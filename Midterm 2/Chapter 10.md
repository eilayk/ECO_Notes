Bank of Canada (BoC)
- Established in 1935, nationalized in 1938
- Prior to the bank, Canada was on the gold standard.  BoC was established due to the collapse of gold
- Has four functions:
	- issue currency
	- banker to the commercial banks
	- banker to the Canadian government
	- control the money supply
- Has power to increase or decrease the number of dollars in the economy
- Important institution because changes in money supply can profoundly affect the economy

How central banks influence money supply
- Act as the banker to commercial banks
- Can control the supply of money by influencing the banking system
	- e.g. reserve ratio, interest rates
- Open market operations
	- Can buy bonds from the public to increase money supply
	- Can sell bonds to the public to reduce money supply
- Changing the bank rate, causing an equal change in the overnight rate
	- Higher overnight rate discourages banks from borrowing reserves from the Bank of Canada, which reduces reserves in the banking system
- Foreign market operations
	- Buying foreign currency increases CAD supply
		- E.g. if BoC buys $100m USD in the forex market for $150m CAD, the CAD supply increases by $150M
	- Selling foreign currency decreases CAD supply
		- if BoC sells foreign currency on the forex market, it receives CAD in exchange and CAD supply decreases
- Changing reserve requirements
	- E.g. raising reserve requirement -> banks must hold more reserves -> lowers money multiplier -> money supply decreases

Functions of money:
- medium of exchange
- unit of account
- store of value

How banks create money:
- Banks only hold a fraction of deposited money as reserves
- The rest is loaned out
- The money that is loaned out re-enters the economy.

Problems in controlling money supply:
- Central bank cannot control the amount of money that people deposit in banks
- Central bank does not control the amount of money that banks choose to lend
