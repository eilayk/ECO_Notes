Financial System: group of institutions that help match one person's savings with another person's investments.
- Financial Markets: savers can directly provide funds to borrowers
- Financial Intermediaries: savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers

Bank: Financial institution whose primary function is to take deposits from savers and use them to make loans to people who want to borrow

Mutual Fund: Sells shares to public and uses the money to buy portfolio of stocks and bonds. The purpose is diversification and allowing experts manage the money

Bond: Certificate of indebtedness that specifies obligation of the borrower to the holder of the bond.
- term
- credit risk

Stock: Ownership in a firm and a claim to its profits

Equity finance: Sale of a stock to raise money

Stock index: Average group of stock prices (e.g. S&P)

Private saving: The income that households have left after paying for taxes and consumption

Public saving: The tax revenue that government has left after paying for taxes and consumption

Budget deficit: Government spends more than it collects in taxes

Budget surplus: Government collects in taxes more than it spends

Market for loanable funds: The market in which those who want to save supply funds and those who want to borrow for investments demand funds

Saving: Source of supply for loanable funds

Investment: Source of demand for loanable funds

Interest rate: Price of a loan 

Natural rate of unemployment: The amount of unemployment the economy naturally experiences
- About 6-7% 

Cyclical unemployment: year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around the natural rate. Closely associated with short-run ups and downs of the economy
- Deviation of unemployment rate from its natural rate

Labour force (LF): Total number of workers, including both employed and unemployed

Unemployment rate (U): percentage of labour force that is unemployed

Labour force participation rate (LFPR):  Percentage of adult population that is in the labour force

Discouraged Searchers: Individuals who would like to work but have given up on looking after failing to find employment

Frictional unemployment: Unemployment as a result of it taking time for workers to search for jobs that match their skills. Explains short spells of unemployment

Structural unemployment: Number of jobs available in a labour market is less than the number of people looking for work

Job search: Process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills

Employment insurance (EI): Government program that partially protects workers' incomes when they become unemployed 
- Reduces harm of unemployment, but the design of the program increases unemployment rate

Union: Worker association that bargains employers over wages and working conditions

Money: sets of assets in the economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services

Medium of exchange: item that buyers give to sellers when they want to purchase good or services

Unit of account: yardstick people use to post prices and record debts

Store of value: an item that people use to transfer purchasing power from present to future

Wealth: total of all stores of value

Liquidity: The ease with which an asset can be converted into a medium of exchange

Commodity money: Money that takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value

Fiat money: Money without intrinsic value, accepted as money because of government decree

Money stock: quantity of money circulating in the economy

Currency: paper bills and coins in the hands of the public

Money supply: quantity of money available in the economy

Demand deposits: balances in bank accounts that the depositors can access on demand by writing a cheque or using debit card

Central bank: Institution designed to regulate the money supply

Monetary policy: the setting of money supply by policymakers in the central bank

Reserves: deposits that banks receive but haven't loaned out

Fractional-reserve banking: banking system in which banks hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves

Reserve ratio: the fraction of deposits that banks hold as reserves

Money multiplier: Amount of money banking system generates with each dollar it receives 
- Reciprocal of reserve ratio

Bank capital: resources bank's owners have put into institution

Leverage: use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment

Leverage ratio: ratio of assets to bank capital
- i.e. how much money is your own vs loans?

Capital requirement: government regulation specifying minimum amount of bank capital

Bank rate: the interest rate charged by the Bank of Canada on loans to commercial banks

Overnight rate: interest rate on short-term loans between commercial banks

Open-market operations: the purchase or sale of government bonds by the central bank

Quantitative easing: the purchase and sale by the central of securities with long maturity terms

Foreign exchange market operations: the purchase or sale of foreign money by the central bank

Reserve requirement: regulations on minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold against deposits

Sterilization: the process of offsetting foreign exchange market operations with open-market operations, so that the effect on money-supply is cancelled out

Inflation: Increase in overall price level

Deflation: Fall in overall price level

Inflation rate: Percentage change in indicators like CPI, GDP deflator, or other indexes

Quantity theory of money: The quantity of money available determines the price level and growth rate of quantity of money available determines inflation

Liquidity preference: The demand for money (how much people will want to hold money in liquid form)

Monetary injection: Increasing the supply of money

Nominal variables: Variables measured in monetary units

Real variables: Variables measured in physical units

Classical dichotomoy: Theoretical seperation of nominal and real variables

Monetary neutrality: Proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables

Velocity of money (V): Rate at which money changes hands

Quantity equation: relates quantity of money, velocity of money, and dollar value of economy's output of goods and services

Inflation tax: revenue government raises by creating money

Fisher effect: one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to inflation rate

Shoeleather costs: Resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings

Menu costs: costs of changing prices

**Formulas**
GDP:
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
where $Y$ is GDP

In a closed economy:
$$
NX = 0
$$
$$
Y = C + I + G
$$
$$
S = I = Y-C-G
$$
Where S is national saving

$$
S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)
$$
Where T is taxes collected by the government minus transfer payments

$$
Private\ Saving = Y - T - C
$$
$$
Budget\ Deficit = T > G
$$
$$
Budget\ Surplus = T < G
$$
Labor force
$$
LF = No_{employed} + No_{unemployed}
$$ where LF is labour force

$$
U = \frac{No_{employed}}{LF} \times 100
$$

where U is unemployment rate

$$
LFPT = \frac{LF}{Adult \ Population} \times 100
$$

$$
Money\ multiplier = \frac{1}{R}
$$
where R is reserve ratio

Velocity of money:
$$
V = \frac{P \times Y}{M}
$$

Quantity equation:
$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$
Where:
- V is velocity of money
- Y is real GDP
- P is price level
- M is quantity of money

$$
Real \ Interest \ Rate = Nominal \ Interest \ rate - Inflation \ rate
$$
$$
Nominal \ Interest \ Rate = Real \ interest \ rate + Inflation \ Rate 
$$
