Financial System: group of institutions that help match one person's savings with another person's investments.
- Financial Markets: savers can directly provide funds to borrowers
- Financial Intermediaries: savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers

Bank: Financial institution whose primary function is to take deposits from savers and use them to make loans to people who want to borrow

Mutual Fund: Sells shares to public and uses the money to buy portfolio of stocks and bonds. The purpose is diversification and allowing experts manage the money

Bond: Certificate of indebtedness that specifies obligation of the borrower to the holder of the bond.
- term
- credit risk

Stock: Ownership in a firm and a claim to its profits

Equity finance: Sale of a stock to raise money

Stock index: Average group of stock prices (e.g. S&P)

Accounting: How various numbers are defined and added up

National saving (S): Total income in the economy that remains after paying for consumption and government purchases

Private saving: The income that households have left after paying for taxes and consumption

Public saving: The tax revenue that government has left after paying for taxes and consumption

Budget deficit: Government spends more than it collects in taxes

Budget surplus: Government collects in taxes more than it spends

Market for loanable funds: The market in which those who want to save supply funds and those who want to borrow for investments demand funds

Saving: Source of supply for loanable funds

Investment: Source of demand for loanable funds

Interest rate: Price of a loan 

Influencing the market for loanable funds:
- Saving incentives: A higher savings rate could lead to higher rate of growth of GDP
	- Ex: RRSPs, TFSAs, RESPs,
	- Causes increase in supply of loanable funds
- Investment incentives: Tax credit given to firms building new factories, purchasing new equipment, etc.
	- Causes increase in demand of loanable funds
- Government budget deficits and surpluses
	- Government debt: The sum of past budget deficits and surpluses
		- A budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds 
		- A surplus increases the supply of loanable funds
	- Crowding out: A decrease in investment as a result of government borrowing

Vicious circle of government debt
- Deficits reduce the supply of loanable funds, increase interest rate, discourage investment, and result in slower economic growth
- Slower growth results in less tax revenue and higher spending on support-programs which further increases deficit

Virtuous circle of government surplus
- Surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduce interest rate, stimulate investment, and result in faster economic growth.
- Faster growth further increases tax revenue and results in less government spending on income-assistance programs

**Formulas**
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
where $Y$ is GDP

In a closed economy:
$$
NX = 0
$$
$$
Y = C + I + G
$$
$$
S = I = Y-C-G
$$
Where S is national saving

$$
S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)
$$
Where T is taxes collected by the government minus transfer payments

$$
Private\ Saving = Y - T - C
$$
$$
Budget\ Deficit = T > G
$$
$$
Budget\ Surplus = T < G
$$

Important notes:
- Saving = Investment (identity)
