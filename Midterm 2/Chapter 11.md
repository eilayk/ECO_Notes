Inflation: Increase in overall price level

Deflation: Fall in overall price level

Inflation rate: Percentage change in indicators like CPI, GDP deflator, or other indexes

Quantity theory of money: The quantity of money available determines the price level and growth rate of quantity of money available determines inflation

Liquidity preference: The demand for money (how much people will want to hold money in liquid form)

Monetary injection: Increasing the supply of money

Nominal variables: Variables measured in monetary units

Real variables: Variables measured in physical units

Classical dichotomoy: Theoretical seperation of nominal and real variables

Monetary neutrality: Proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables

Velocity of money (V): Rate at which money changes hands

Quantity equation: relates quantity of money, velocity of money, and dollar value of economy's output of goods and services

Inflation tax: revenue government raises by creating money

Fisher effect: one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to inflation rate

Shoeleather costs: Resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings

Menu costs: costs of changing prices

Can view economy's overall price level as:
- The price of a basket of goods and services
- Measure of the value of money

Demand and value of money
- The value of money is determined by the supply and demand for money
- The supply of money is controlled by the Bank of Canada and the banking system
- The demand for money reflects how much people will want to hold it in liquid form

Factors affecting demand for money:
- Most important variable is level of prices in the economy
- In the long run, overall level of prices adjusts to the level at which demand for money equals supply

Properties of velocity and quantity of money
- Velocity is stable over time
- Therefore, changes to quantity of money causes proportionate change in nominal value of output ($P \times Y$)
- Output of goods and services (Y) is primary determined by factor supplies and technology. Money is neutral therefore does not affect output
- Since Y is determined by factor supplies and technology
	- When central bank alters M,
	- proportional changes reflected in ($P \times Y$),
	- changes reflected in changes in price level
- When central bank increases money supply rapidly, results in higher rate of inflation.

Costs of inflation
- Shoeleather costs
- Menu costs
- Raising tax burden on income earned from saving
	- The interest earned counts as income and is taxed, even though that income might only cover inflation
	- Therefore, discourages savings

Inflation vs. Deflation:
- Similar costs
- Deflation considered worse than inflation
- Redistribution of wealth towards creditors and away from debtors
- A sign of troubled economy


Velocity of money:
$$
V = \frac{P \times Y}{M}
$$

Quantity equation:
$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$
Where:
- V is velocity of money
- Y is real GDP
- P is price level
- M is quantity of money

$$
Real \ Interest \ Rate = Nominal \ Interest \ rate - Inflation \ rate
$$
$$
Nominal \ Interest \ Rate = Real \ interest \ rate + Inflation \ Rate 
$$
