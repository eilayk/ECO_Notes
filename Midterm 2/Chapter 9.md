Natural rate of unemployment: The amount of unemployment the economy naturally experiences
- About 6-7% 

Cyclical unemployment: year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around the natural rate. Closely associated with short-run ups and downs of the economy
- Deviation of unemployment rate from its natural rate

Labour force (LF): Total number of workers, including both employed and unemployed

Unemployment rate (U): percentage of labour force that is unemployed

Labour force participation rate (LFPR):  Percentage of adult population that is in the labour force

Discouraged Searchers: Individuals who would like to work but have given up on looking after failing to find employment

Frictional unemployment: Unemployment as a result of it taking time for workers to search for jobs that match their skills. Explains short spells of unemployment

Structural unemployment: Number of jobs available in a labour market is less than the number of people looking for work

Job search: Process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills

Employment insurance (EI): Government program that partially protects workers' incomes when they become unemployed 
- Reduces harm of unemployment, but the design of the program increases unemployment rate

Union: Worker association that bargains employers over wages and working conditions

Measuring unemployment:
- Every month, Stats Canada conducts the Labour Force Survey (LFS)
- Sample of 54000 households
- Data produced on:
	- Unemployment
	- Types of employment
	- Length of the average workweek
	- Duration of unemployment

Labour force: Stats Canada places each adult (aged 15 or older) into one of three categories
	- Employed
	- Unemployed
	- Not in labour force

Employment status:
- A person is employed if they spent some of the previous week working at a paid job
- A person is unemployed if they are on temporary layoff or looking for a job
- A person who isn't looking for a job is considered not in labour force

Problems with unemployment rate:
- Hard to interpret because:
- not all unemployed people looking for a job
- people calling themselves unemployed to receive employment insurance
- people who are officially unemployed but working under the table

Unemployment statistics:
- In 2020, the average spell of unemployment was 15.2 weeks
- One third of unemployed people are only unemployed for a month or less
- Two third of unemployed people are only unemployed less than 3 months
- Therefore, policies should be directed at addressing those suffering from prolonged unemployment

Types of unemployment:
- Frictional unemployment
	- Inevitable because the economy is always changing
	- A result of a well-functioning society that rewards innovation and new ideas
- Structural unemployment
	- Occurs when wages are above equilibrium level
		- Above-equilibrium wage (minimum wage laws)
		- Unions
		- Efficiency wages

Minimum wage laws:
- Can set the minimum wage above equilibrium level
- Quantity of jobs available is less than quantity of labour force
- Results in structural unemployment

Efficiency wages:
- Above-equilibrium wages paid by firms to increase employee productivity
- Higher wages increase the efficiency of workers and increase profitability of the firm, even if it causes a surplus of labour

$$
LF = No_{employed} + No_{unemployed}
$$ where LF is labour force

$$
U = \frac{No_{employed}}{LF} \times 100
$$

where U is unemployment rate

$$
LFPT = \frac{LF}{Adult \ Population} \times 100
$$
