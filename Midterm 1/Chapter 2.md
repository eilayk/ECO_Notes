Economic model: A simplified representation of a more complicated reality
- Uses reasonable assumptions to simplify the situation
- Often in the form of diagrams and equations

Positive statements: can be confirmed or refuted based on evidence

Normative statements: cannot be confirmed or refuted based on evidence

Economics is a social science.
- Economic theory must be combined with observations/evidence to conduct economic analysis and draw conclusions.
- Economists use models to study economic issues

Positive correlation: Event A and event B both rise or both fall

Negative correlation: Event A and rises while event B falls or vice versa

Causation: One event brings about another

The Circular Flow Model:
- Shows how dollars flow through markets
- Two actors:
	- Households
		- Own means of production and sell/rent them in exchange for income
		- Buy and consume goods and services
	- Firms
		- By/hire factors of production and use them to produce goods and services
		- Sell goods and services
- Micro focus: interaction between households and firms in the market of goods and services
- Macro focus: can be applied to a nation - the model defines GDP

The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) Model:
- Graph that shows the combination of outputs that economy can produce given the factors of production and technology.
	- Points on the PPF are efficient
	- Points below the PPF are inefficient since resources are underutilized
	- Points above the PPF are impossible to achieve
- Reword: Compares the production of two resources.
- Slope signifies opportunity cost
	- In the example, opportunity cost of a computer is 100 tons of wheat
- PPF can be a straight line or bow-shaped, depending on what happens to opportunity cost as the economy shifts from a resource to another

Causation vs correlation:
- Two events may be correlated without having a causal relationship
- This can happen if there is a third variable that affects both events.
- correlation $\neq$ causation !!!!
