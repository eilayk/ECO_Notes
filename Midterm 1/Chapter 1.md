Economics: Study of how scarce resources are allocated

Macroeconomics: Studies the economy's structure, operation, and performance as a whole

Opportunity cost: whatever must be given up to obtain it. 
- Example: An extra year of university is not just tuition, books, and fees but also forgone wages

Margin: difference/change

Incentive: something that induces someone to behave a specific way

Market: how buyers and sellers trade a particular product. Can be physical place or website.

GDP (gross domestic product) per capita: amount of goods produced per hour of a worker's time

Inflation: the increase in overall level of prices

Price level formula:
- $P$ is price level
- $\pi$ is inflation rate
- $n$ is number of years
$$P_{2} = P_{1}(1+\pi)^n$$

Unemployment: Number of people who don't have a job are seeking one

Measures of macroeconomic performance:
- GDP
- Inflation
- Unemployment


10 principles of economics:
1. People face trade-offs
	- Efficiency vs equity
2. Opportunity cost is the true cost
3. Rational people think at the margin
	- Rational people evaluate the costs and benefits of marginal changes
	- I.e. a student doing extra year of university compares the cost and reward
		- cost: fees, tuition, books, year of foregone wages
		- rearward: the fees and forgone wages to the extra income he could earn 
4. Rational people respond to incentives
	- In response to higher gas prices, sales of hybrid cars rise
5. Trade can make everyone better off
	- Instead of being a jack-of-all-trades, people specialize in one good or service and exchange for other ones.
6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
	- Since rational people capitalize on opportunities to get what they want, if a profit-making opportunity exists, someone will capitalize on it
	- Market economies are efficient
7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
	- Markets sometimes fail to allocate resources efficiently. Reasons:
		- Externalities: the production/consumption of a product affects third parties (e.g. causes a lot of pollution)
		- Market power: small numbers of buyers or sellers have substantial influence on market price
	- If the market fails, government can impose policy that improves efficiency
	- Governments also alter markets to promote equity at the expense of efficiency
8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
	- Measured as GDP per capita
9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money
	- Due to inflation
10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
	- High unemployment causes GDP to fall
	- Economic policies to reduce unemployment result increase inflation
	- Economic policies to reduce inflation result in unemployment
	- Need to find the right balance between the two

Categorizing the principles:
- 1-4: about decision making
- 5-7: interacting
- 8-10: how the economy works as a whole
