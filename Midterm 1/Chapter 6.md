Cost of living: level of prices in an economy

Purchasing power: how much a dollar can buy given prices

Consumer Price Index: (CPI): Measures price changes by comparing the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services over a period of time
- Used to make cost of living adjustments in wages, pensions, government social programs

Canadian Pension Plan (CPP): mandatory federal public pension plan
- Adjusted yearly based on CPI changes

OAS: Non-contributory, residence-based program with the objective of ensuring a minimum income to Canadians aged 65 and over.
- Adjusted quarterly to reflect increases in CPI

Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): program that provides monthly non-taxable benefit to OAS recipients in low income
- Adjusted quarterly to reflect increases in CPI

Producer Price Indexes (PPIs): Like CPI, a PPI measures the cost of a given basket of goods
- There are many PPIs that cover different economic activities
- PPIs measure prices that producers receive, meaning it is caught higher in the value/supply chain
	- Thus, they can signal changes in CPI before they happen

Indexation: wages rise (albeit slowly) over time to offset effects of inflation and maintain purchasing power
- A dollar amount is indexed for inflation if it is automatically corrected to inflation by law or contract

The law of one price: goods should sell for the same price in all markets

Purchasing power parity (PPP): Theory that purchasing power in different countries should be the same when stated in a common currency
- Based on law of one price

The Big Mac Index: PPP index that describes differences in prices for Big Macs across locations

Nominal interest rate: not corrected for inflation
- the rate of growth in the dollar value of a deposit or debt

real interest rate: corrected for inflation
- the rate of growth in purchasing power of a debt or deposit


Calculating CPI:
$$
CPI = \frac{Cost \: of \: basket \: in \: desired \: year }{Cost \: of \: basket \: in \: desired \: year} \times 100
$$
Calculating inflation rate:
- Uses percent change in CPI

$$
inflation\:rate=\frac{CPI\:this\:period\:-\:CPI\:for\:previous\:period}{CPI\:for\:previous\:period}\times100
$$

Bias in CPI:
1. Commodity substitution bias
	- Some prices rise faster than others
	- When consumers substitute for a cheaper product, it's not reflected in CPI because it's fixed
	- Thus, CPI overstates increase in cost of living
2. New goods bias
	- Introduction of new goods increases variety
	- The CPI misses this because the basket is fixed
	- Thus, CPI overstates cost of living
3. Quality bias
	- Improvements in quality of goods is an important metric
	- CPI tries to measure this, but it is difficult to measure and misses some
	- Thus, CPI overstates cost of living
4. Outlet bias
	- Outlet stores sell at lower prices
	- It is hard to account for this
	- Thus, the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living

Consequences of the biases:
- CPI overstates cost of living because of the biases
- As a result, wages, private and public pension programs, and etc. may increase by more than necessary to maintain the purchasing power
- The number of people eligible for public benefits is increasing
	- To grow from 5.4 mil in 2013 to 10.7 mil in 2040
- Reducing the biases would improve the accuracy of the CPI, resulting in savings for businesses and taxpayers

GDP Deflator vs CPI:
- Economists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and CPI to gauge price growths

3 important differences between GDP deflator and CPI:
1. Each measures a different set of goods and services
	- GDP deflator reflects domestic goods and services
	- CPI reflects prices of items bought by a typical person
2. GDP deflator only includes domestic good and services, meanwhile CPI includes imports
3. CPI basket is fixed over a period of two years, meanwhile GDP updates yearly

Comparing prices from two different years:
- Can also use PPI or GDP deflator to compare
$$
price\:in\:desired\:year=price\:in\:base\:year\:\times\frac{CPI\:in\:desired\:year}{CPI\:in\:base\:year}
$$
Comparing values of currency using PPP index method 1:
$$
Y=\frac{currency_{1}-currency_{2}}{currency_{2}}\times100
$$
where Y is the value of currency2 relative to currency1. 

Comparing different GDP per capita using PPP indexes:
E.g. comparing using USD and peso
- PPP index: 1 USD should trade for 9.52 pesos
- market exchange rate: 21.32 pesos for 1 USD
$$
\frac{9.52-21.32}{21.32}*100=-55.3\%
$$
- Thus, peso was undervalued by 55.3%. And, the cost of living was about half that of the US
- Next, adjust GDP per capita to reflect lower prices
$$
\frac{8329.27\:USD}{1-0.553}=18633.71\:USD
$$
The average person in Mexico has a standard of living comparable to someone earning $18633.71 in the US

Formula:
$$
 price\:level\:adustment=\frac{PPP\:Index-Market\:ER}{Market\:ER}\times100
$$
$$
PPP\:adjusted\:GDP\:per\:capita=\frac{GDP\:per\:capita}{1+Price\:level\:adjustment}
$$
Nominal vs real interest rates:
- nominal interest rate = i
- real interest rate = r
- inflation = $\pi$
approximate formula:
$$
r \approx i - \pi
$$
real formula:
$$
r=\frac{i-\pi}{1+\pi}
$$

Example (using approximate formula):
- You deposit $100
- grows by 3% after a year
- CPI is 1.4%
- your purchasing power (real interest rate) grows by 1.6%
