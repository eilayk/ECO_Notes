GDP: 
- Value of all economic activity within a country
- The unduplicated market value of all goods & services produced within a country in a given period of time.

Defining goods and services for GDP:
- All goods valued at market value (including sales tax)
- Measured in the same units (dollars in Canada)
- Unduplicated: Only counting the goods and services intended for the end user.
	- value of intermediate goods - such as those used in the production are not counted because
	- they are already included in the value of final goods
	- excluded to prevent double counting

GDP per capita: $\frac{GDP}{population}$

Net exports (NX): exports - imports 

Gross National Income (GNI) and Gross National Product (GNP):
- All final goods and services produced by a countryâ€™s residents, regardless of where they live.

Capital consumption allowance: depreciation

Net National Product (NNP): GNP - depreciation 

National Income (NI): NNP - sales tax + subsidies

Personal Income (PI): NI + income received but not earned  - income earned but not received

Disposable personal income: PI - personal income taxes

GDP Deflator: $\frac{GDP_{Nominal}}{GDP_{Real}}*100$
- Can be used to find inflation rate between two given years

Nominal GDP: The strength of the economy in current $
- Grows both because prices rise and because the economy grows
- Can increase due to inflation

Real GDP: The strength of the economy in the $ of a previous year
- Takes inflation out of the economy
- Can really see if the economy grew or shrunk


Circular flow diagram revisited:
- The diagram is a simple depiction of GDP
![[public/ECON/ECO_Notes/Midterm 1/img/circular-flow 2.png]]

Can calculate GDP using:
- spending
- income
- value-added

4 Components of spending
- Consumption (C)
- Investment (I)
- Government Purchases (G)
- Net Exports (NX)

$$GDP = C + I + G + NX = production = income$$
Added up, the 4 components of spending equals the GDP

Measuring GDP with income:
- Wages (including benefits)
- Return to capital
	- net operating surplus plus depreciation
- sales tax
GDP = wages + return to capital + sales tax

Measuring GDP with value-added:
- measures the value of economic output
- the value that each transaction adds to the economy

Finding inflation using GDP deflator:
$$
\frac{{GDP \: Deflator}_{current \: year} - {GDP \: Deflator}_{previous \: year}}{{GDP \: Deflator}_{previous \: year}}*100
$$

GDP is very useful for determining the well-being of a country, but should be taken with scrutiny. There are other more useful measurements for specific things.
