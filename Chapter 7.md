Compounding: Economic growth builds on itself over time

Productivity: The average quantity of goods and services produced per hour of a worker's time

Free trade: the principle that trade can make everyone better off

Convergence theory: countries that start out poor will grow faster than rich ones, but eventually converge to the same level of growth as the rich countries

GDP growth rate:
$$
Growth\:rate = \%\Delta\:real\:GDP\:per\:capita
$$
$$
Growth\:rate = \% \Delta in\:nominal\:GDP - \%\Delta in\:GDP\:deflator - \%\Delta in\:Population
$$
$$
Growth\:rate = \%\Delta in\:nominal\:GDP - inflation - \%\Delta in\:population
$$

Compounding formula:
$$
GDP_{yr\:A}\times(1+g)^n=GDP_{yr\:B}
$$
where
- g = annual average growth rate
- n = number of years

Rule of 70: simple way to check how long it takes for income to double
$$
n=\frac{70}{g\times100}
$$
where
- n = number of years
- g = percent interest rate

The four components of productivity:
- Physical capital (K)
	- Stock of machinery, equipment, and structures that enable production of goods and services
- Human Capital (H)
	- The skills, knowledge, experience, and talent that workers acquire through training and experience
- Natural Resources (N)
	- The factors of production that nature provides (e.g. minerals, petroleum, trees)
- Technological Improvements (A)
	- New ideas, products, and processes for producing goods and services
	- Innovations increase efficiency, increasing productivity

Total production output:
$$
Total\:Production = A \times F(L,K,H,N)
$$
- Notice that A multiplies the total production

Properties of total production output:
- increasing all the inputs by a factor also increases the output by that factor

Public policy can raise productivity by effecting the determinants/factors of productivity
- Governments need to enforce property rights to drive investment
- Governments can implement policies that raise saving and investment

Investment trade-off: 
- Since resources are scarce, producing more capital requires producing fewer consumption goods
	- reduced consumption -> increasing domestic saving
	- extra saving -> more investment in the production of goods
- This growth is temporary since:
	- as K rises, the extra output from each additional unit of K falls
- Not too sure about this topic need to watch the video
	- won't be on the midterm though so I won't

Productivity links:
- Education
	- Government can increase productivity by promoting education
	- This is an investment in human capital
- Health and nutrition:
	- Healthier workers are more productive
	- In countries with significant malnourishment, raising workers' caloric intake raises productivity
- Trade
	- similar effects as discovering new technologies
	- countries with outward-oriented policies (promote free trade) have done economically better than countries with inward-oriented policies (avoid interaction with other countries)

Research and development:
- Technical progress is the main reason for rise in living standards in the long run
- Can implement policies to promote technical progress
	- Patent laws
	- Tax incentives for the R&D sector
	- Grants for research at universities

Natural resources and economic growth:
- It can be argued that population growth is depleting Earth of non-renewable resources, and thus limit growth
- Technical progress often finds ways to avoid these limits, such as creating hybrid cars that use less gas
- resource scarcity drives up prices -> creating more incentive to find an alternative

3 characteristics of population growth:
- Stretching natural resources
- Diluting the capital stock
- Promoting technical progress

Malthus's theory:
- Population growth would strain society's ability to provide for itself
- Malthus was wrong, as living standards rose (instead of decline) even though Earth's population rose drastically
